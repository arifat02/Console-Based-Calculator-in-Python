Console-Based Calculator in Python

This is a basic, console-based calculator application built with Python, designed to perform common mathematical operations. 

This calculator handles the following operations:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers.

Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.

Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
Exponentiation (^): Calculates the power of a base raised to an exponent.

Square Root (sqrt): Calculates the square root of a number, with error handling for negative inputs.


Key Features

Error Handling: Prevents division by zero and attempts to find the square root of a negative number.
User Input: Prompts the user to select an operation and enter the required numbers.

Modular Structure: Each operation has dedicated input and error handling for clean and manageable code.


Requirements

Python 3.x

The math library (standard in Python)


Usage

Run the script, select an operation, and follow the prompts to enter numbers. The calculator will print the result or display a "Math Error" if an invalid calculation is attempted.
